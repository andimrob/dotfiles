# Rob's kickass dotfiles

### Installation


If this is a fresh MacOS installation first we need Xcode:
```
sudo xcode-select --install
```

Next we clone and run the installation script:
```
g clone git@github.com:andimrob/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./install
```

On a fresh MasOC installation we will also want to install all our apps and tools using brew at this point:
```
brew bundle install --global
```
